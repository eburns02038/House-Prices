# House-Prices
House Price Prediction Model

Project goals: 
1) Build a model using local data for recently sold properties in Orlando, FL
2) Build a model using regional data for recently sold properties in Central Florida
3) Compare models to examine performance of regional vs local models on predicting property prices


Initial modeling: 
- Basic model that is the simplest possible version of the model that can be used as a baseline to compare future models to
- - Simple linear regression using just sqft of property to predict lastSoldPrice
    
Future Models to Try
- Linear Regression
- Polynomial Regression
- Lasso Regression
- Elastic Net Regression
- Decision Tree Based Regression (?)
- Support Vector Regression (SVR) (?)
- XGBoost
